## Preliminaries
Set working directory
Install {stringr} package in R
```{preliminaries}
setwd("/Users/samanthavee/Documents/Github/AN588-Week-2")
library("stringr") #loads package
```

## Matrices and arrays
```{r}
m <- matrix(data = c(1, 2, 3, 4), nrow=2, ncol=2); m
m <- matrix(data=c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), nrow=2, ncol=3, byrow=FALSE); m

v1 <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
v2 <- c(6, 7, 8, 9)
m1 <- rbind(v1, v2); m1 #bind by row
m2 <- cbind(v1, v2); m2 #bind by column

class(m1)
dim(m1) #tells us there's 2 rows and 4 columns
class(m2)
dim(m2) #tells us there's 4 rows and 2 columns
colnames(m2)
rownames(m2)
str(m2) #summarizes aspects of data structure

a <- array(data = 1:90, dim = c(5,6,3)); a #5 rows, 6 columns, broken up into 3 sets
```

## Subsetting 
```{r}
v <- 1:100; v #creates vector containing all integers from 1 to 100
v [1:15] #select first 15 elements
v[c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)] #subset specific values
v <- 101:200 #create vector containing all integers from 101-200
v[seq(from = 1, to = 100, by = 2)] #create vector starting at 1, ending at 100, count by 2
```

## Challenge 1
```{r challenge 1}
v1 <- c('Stately', ',', 'plump', 'Buck', 'Mulligan', 'came', 'from', 'the', 'stairhead', ',', 'bearing', 'a', 'bowl', 'of', 'lather', 'on', 'which', 'a', 'mirror', 'and', 'a', 'razor', 'lay', 'crossed', '.'); v1
#one way to split up character 

v2 <- "Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed."; v2 #entire sentence is one character 
v2<- gsub("[[:punct:]]","",v2); v2 #remove punctuation
v2 <- str_split(v2, " "); v2 #splits up sentence so each word is its own character
v2.1 <- v2[seq(from = 1, to = length(v2), by = 3)]; v2.1 #this should work, not sure why it's not working
```

## Challenge 2
```{r challenge 2}
m <- matrix(data = 1:80, nrow =8, ncol = 10, byrow = FALSE); m
x <- m[4,5]; x #extract element in row 4, column 5 and assign to new variable x

#extract 2nd, 3rd, 6th COLUMNS and assign to new variable x
x <- m[, c(2,3,6)]; x

#extract 6th to 8th ROW and assign to new variable x
x <- m[6:8, ]; x

#extract elements from [row 2, column 2] to [row 6, column 9] and assign to new variable x
x <- m[2:6, 2:9]; x
```

## Challenge 3
```{r challenge 3}
#construct four dimensional, 400 element array (5x5x4x4) consisting of numbers descending from 400 to 1
a <- array(data = 400:1, dim = c(5,5,4,4)); a #outputs 16 matrices

a[1,1,1,2]
#returns value 300; comes from row 1 and column 1 (1,1) of matrix (1,2)

a[2,3,2,]
# returns [1] 364 264 164 64
# elements from row 2 and column 3 (2,3) of matrices (2, 1:4)

a[1:5, 1:5, 3, 3]
#returns elements from rows and columns 1:5, aka all elements, of (3,3) matrix
```

## Overwriting
``` {r overwriting}
m[7,1] <- 564; m 
# replaces value (7) in row 7, column 1 with value 564
m[,8] <- 2; m 
# replaces all values in column 8 with value 2
m[2:5, 4:8] <- 1; m 
# replaces all values in rows 2-5, columns 4-8 with value 1
m[2:5, 4:8] <- c(20, 19, 18, 17); m 
# replaces values in rows 2:5, columns 4:8 with 20, 19, 18, 17, respectively
m[2:5, 4:8] <- matrix(data = c(20:1), nrow = 4, ncol = 5, byrow = TRUE); m 
# same as previous but replaced with descending values 20 to 1
# byrow = TRUE fills matrices by row, default is byrow = TRUE which fills matrices by column
m[,8] <- c("a", "b"); m 
#replaces values in column 8 with alternating "a" and "b" characters
```
## Lists and data frames

## Challenge 4

```
## Filtering 
``` {r filtering}

```
## Factors, conversion and coercion, and special data values

```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
